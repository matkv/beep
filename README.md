# beep
A small program that plays a sound when clicking an icon in the system tray / tray bar. It is used to wake up my studio monitor speakers from the sleep mode.

There are already two versions of this functionality using separate scripts for Windows & Linux. This project is supposed to be a solution for both platforms. This is my first actual project in Rust. The [tray item crate](https://crates.io/crates/tray-item) will probably be helpful for this.
